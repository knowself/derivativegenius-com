feat(ui): Migrate from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS - Dawn of Modern UI Architecture

This landmark commit marks the transition of Derivative Genius from a traditional 
Bootstrap-based UI to a modern, utility-first approach with Tailwind CSS. This 
fundamental shift represents not just a change in styling framework, but a 
philosophical evolution in how we approach UI development in the age of AI-driven 
business intelligence.

🌟 Strategic Rationale:
- Embrace Vue.js-first development practices
- Enable rapid UI iteration through utility-first design
- Eliminate jQuery dependencies and reduce technical debt
- Set foundation for AI-driven component generation

🏗️ Architectural Changes:
1. Frontend Evolution
   - Removed Bootstrap 5.3.0 dependencies
   - Integrated Tailwind CSS with Vue.js
   - Established utility-first styling paradigm
   - Created foundation for component-based architecture

2. Development Environment
   - Enhanced build pipeline for Tailwind processing
   - Configured PostCSS for optimal CSS generation
   - Integrated with existing Vue.js hot-reload system
   - Updated development scripts for seamless workflow

3. Template Modernization
   - Refactored Django admin templates to use Tailwind
   - Removed Bootstrap JavaScript dependencies
   - Implemented pure CSS solutions for interactive elements
   - Enhanced responsive design patterns

🔧 Technical Implementation:
- Added: tailwind.config.js with Vue.js integration
- Added: PostCSS configuration for modern CSS processing
- Modified: src/assets/tailwind.css for framework initialization
- Updated: App.vue with new component architecture
- Refactored: Admin panel templates with Tailwind classes
- Updated: Development and build scripts

📚 Documentation:
- Updated UI architecture documentation
- Added Tailwind CSS best practices
- Revised component development guidelines
- Enhanced accessibility documentation

🎯 Future Implications:
This transition sets the stage for:
1. AI-Generated UI Components
   - Tailwind's utility classes enable better AI pattern recognition
   - Simplified component generation through clear class patterns
   - Enhanced maintainability of AI-generated code

2. Business Intelligence Features
   - Rapid dashboard prototyping capabilities
   - Consistent design language for data visualization
   - Flexible layouts for complex analytical interfaces

3. Performance Optimization
   - Reduced CSS bundle size through PurgeCSS
   - Improved runtime performance
   - Better caching strategies

4. Developer Experience
   - Faster development cycles
   - More intuitive component creation
   - Better IDE support and tooling

🔄 Migration Notes:
- Preserved existing functionality while modernizing the codebase
- Ensured backward compatibility where necessary
- Added progressive enhancement for modern browsers
- Maintained accessibility standards

🚀 Next Steps:
1. Implement authentication system
2. Develop core dashboard components
3. Create business intelligence widgets
4. Set up Firebase data flows

This commit represents not just a technical upgrade, but a strategic investment
in the future of Derivative Genius's UI architecture. The adoption of Tailwind CSS
positions us at the forefront of modern web development practices, ready to
leverage AI and advanced business intelligence capabilities.
